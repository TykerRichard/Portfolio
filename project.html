            <p class="Description">Embarking on my journey at Western Governors University (WGU), I delved into the world of software development with one of my initial projects. Crafted using <span class="White">JAVA and JAVAFX</span>
                , this Inventory Management application empowers users to seamlessly input, remove, and modify parts, both in-house and external. Additionally, it facilitates the creation of products that depend on specific parts while 
                ensuring rigorous validation of stock availability. The project has reached completion and is available for exploration on GitHub.</p>

            <p class="Description">Throughout my WGU journey, I revisited and enhanced a significant project that played a key role in my Capstone â€“ the Another Mortgage Company Calendar Manager. Originally conceived as my second project, its foundational features, including booking, canceling, 
                and modifying appointments for specific users, were developed during its initial phase. I navigated challenges like handling multiple types of time overlaps and adjusting for time zones based on the local computer time. For the Capstone, I 
                repurposed this application, infusing it with a search feature and incorporating data analytics to meet specific requirements and elevate its capabilities. This dynamic application was crafted using <span class="White">JAVA, JAVAFX, and SQL.</span></p>

            <h1 class="Title">School Calendar System</h1>
            <p class="Description">This portfolio showcases my third project at WGU. The project involved creating an <span class="White">Android App</span> using 
                <span class="White">Java and SQL</span> within Android Studio. The goal was to develop an application for a college environment, enabling users to seamlessly add 
                and remove courses from their schedule. The application incorporated checks to ensure no overlapping courses existed within the schedule. Additionally, it provided 
                specific user privileges to manage the availability of courses.</p>
